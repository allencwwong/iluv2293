                                Fees.  
                               Deposit.  In order to reserve the Hunt Date and in consideration for the advance work City Hunt SF shall complete to create Client’s custom event, Client shall pay City Hunt SF a deposit of 50% of the minimum fee (the “Deposit”).The Deposit is due upon receipt of invoice. The Deposit shall be subtracted from Client’s final invoice. Final payment shall be made on or before the day of your cityHUNT Adventure. In the event of Client’s cancellation of the Hunt, the Deposit shall be non-refundable, but may be applied to another hunt scheduled by the client that takes place within one (1) year of the Hunt Date.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            
                                Total Fee. In consideration for City Hunt SF’s services in connection with these terms, Client shall pay City Hunt SF the amount outlined on the invoice based on the number of participants. Client shall notify City Hunt SF of the final number of participants no later than 48 hours prior to the start of the Hunt. The minimum total participant fee(the “Minimum Fee”) or the final number of participants (as outlined above), whichever is greater, is due regardless of the number of participants who attend the Hunt.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Overtime.  Should Client request that City Hunt SF extend the duration of the Hunt beyond the contracted-for time in Section 1 above, Client shall pay to City Hunt SF $200 per additional hour City Hunt SF Event Guides are present.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Final payment shall be made in full at the conclusion of the Hunt upon presentation of a final invoice. Invoices unpaid after thirty (30) days shall incur a 1.5% per month interest rate charge until such balance is paid.

                            <li>
                                Changes or Cancellations.  In the event Client desires a change to the starting time of the Hunt, Client must notify City Hunt SF no later than one (1) week prior to the Hunt Date.  In the event Client desires a change to the Hunt Date or cancel the Hunt altogether, Client shall notify City Hunt SF no later two (2) weeks prior to the Hunt Date.  In the case of a date postponement or Hunt cancellation in compliance with the above time frame, Client shall still be responsible and reimburse City Hunt SF for any out-of-pocket expenses and/or travel-related costs incurred by City Hunt SF as a result of such compliant change or cancellation. Failure of Client to notify City Hunt SF of cancellation no less than two (2) weeks prior to the Hunt Date shall result in the Minimum Fee becoming non-refundable and out-of-pocket and/or travel-related costs reimbursable; payable to City Hunt SF within seven (7) days of any such cancellation by Client.  Should City Hunt SF cancel the event for any reason except those contained in Section four below, City Hunt SF shall refund Client’s Deposit.
                            </li>
<li>

    Delays or Postponements.  If the starting time of the Hunt is delayed as a result of circumstances beyond City Hunt SF’s control (i.e. hazardous weather, dangerous road conditions, mechanical problems, etc.) City Hunt SF will use its best efforts to fulfill this Agreement by adjusting the time of this Hunt to a mutually satisfactory one. The Hunt, however, shall take place rain or shine.  Any decision by Client to cancel event due to weather (unless cancelled within the timeframe set forth in Section 3 above) shall subject Client to cancellation fees detailed in Section 3 above.

<li>
    Hunt Behavior.  Client shall be fully and solely responsible for any damage or loss to City Hunt SF equipment used during the Hunt.

</li>
<li>

In the unlikely event a participant is removed from the Hunt, Client shall not be entitled to a refund for the removed-participant.
</li>

<li>
    City Hunt SF is not an actual scavenger hunt company. It is a dummy site for me to use scavenger as an event to propose to my long time girlfriend. 
</li>
 
<li>
    Releases  Client hereby agrees that City Hunt SF may take pictures and video of the Hunt and may use such pictures or videos, along with Client’s name, for promotional and other business purposes, including but not limited to social media platforms.
